        <p>
          Two years ago I graduated from Washburn University with a bachelors of science in actuarial science and a minor in computer science.
          During my time at Washburn, I began to develop a love for programming. My original focus was on object oriented programming using Java,
          but in recent years I have taken up web development. Consequently, in March of 2023, I enrolled in the Code Bootcamp at Kansas University, 
          an intensive 24 week program to develop my skills as a web developer. Through this I have found a path that I love and am very passionate about.
          While I prefer remote work, I am open to either hybrid or fully in person jobs if the right opportunity presents itself.
